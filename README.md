# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise recently failed to reach a financial goal although she had 10 strong backers. She is looking for further insight into what actions could improve her future campaign to fund the production of her play.

### Purpose
Create infographics to view factors and describe trends that have contributed to how other campaigns fared in relation to goals and launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Louise had a lot of interests and analyzing the data was difficult. I spent a lot of time investigating the functionality of Excel, the chart fields, the ribbon, filters, etc. I flipped back and forth between worksheets with VLOOKUP, STDEV, and other formulas. I looked beyond the exercises and got lost investingating potental ways to utilize the amount of data available in this workbook. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There are far more successful outcomes with Launch Dates in May than other months. There is a trends of failed campaigns that hover between 55 and 35 all year long.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As campaign goals increase the percentage of success decreases.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesn't declare a cost of production and budget. Louise estimated that her cost would be 1200 dollars. However there is no data related to cost.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Measuring Outcomes by Number of Backers and Length of Campaign, Outcomes by Average Donation and Lenth of Campaign
