Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project
Louise recently failed to reach a financial goal although she had 10 strong backers. Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Use the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. She is looking for further insight into what actions could improve her future campaign to fund the production of her play.

Purpose
I want to create infographics to view factors and describe trends that have contributed to how other campaigns fared in relation to goals and launch dates. We can use visualization to evaluate successful, failed and canceled campaigns. The purpose of these insights is to improve our understanding of trends and realize success in future funding campaigns.


Analysis and Challenges

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I spent extra time investigating the functionality of Excel, the chart fields, the ribbon, filters, etc. I flipped back and forth between worksheets with VLOOKUP, STDEV, and other formulas. I looked beyond the exercises and got lost investigating potential ways to utilize the amount of data available in this workbook. I left filters on in the Kickstarter Worksheet which caused an impairment to advance my analysis accurately. Many times I had to reread the methods for a better understanding of what the chart was supposed to look like and how to put it together.

Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
First the launch date chart seems to identify the popular season for successful funding outcomes. The chart visibly identified successful outcomes with launch dates in May with comparison to the other months. June and July are also good months for successful outcomes. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It appears that as campaign goals increase the percentage of success decreases. The goals between 1000 and 10000 are the most popular are of the chart and represents the most successful outcomes.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Louise estimated that her cost would be 1200 dollars. However there is no data related to the cost of the productions. That information could  be useful for targeting outcomes with consideration for how relevant campaign funding levels are to cost of production.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would like to see Measuring Outcomes by Number of Backers and Length of Campaign or Outcomes by Average Donation and Length of Campaign.
